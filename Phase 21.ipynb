    "### Data Description\n",
    "1. What are the observations (rows) and the attributes (columns)?   \n",
    "Each observation is a fight, and each row contains both the fighters’ information. The attributes capture the statistics that were available at the time of the event for each fighter. Most of the information is the rate of a certain action per fifteen minutes. For example, column B_avg_SIG_STR_landed displays a fighter’s significant strikes landed per fifteen minutes. \n",
    "1. Why was this dataset created?     \n",
    "The dataset was created on Kaggle and it hosts competitions for predicting the outcomes for upcoming UFC fights. There are several authors and the most prominent custodian, whose GitHub name is Shortlikeafox, web scraped the gambling data in the hopes of creating a profitable UFC gambling algorithm using machine learning. \n",
    "1. Who funded the creation of the dataset?    \n",
    "The raw data comes from UFCStats.com or sportsbets.com. Sportsbets.com is a online sportsbooks that makes money through setting gambling lines where they are likely to make money. The UFC hosts and televises fights and keeping record is an important part of nerdy fan interaction with the sport. The data scientists that cobbled the dataset together did not state that they were compensated. However, I'd imagine that Shortlikeafox is hoping to create a profitable betting algorithm. \n",
    "1. What processes might have influenced what data was observed and recorded and what was not?    \n",
    "The UFC is where only well-established fighters perform. All the fighters listed in the dataset have an extensive amateur career that is not included.  The data from any fight outside of the UFC is not considered because there is no central Mixed Martial arts database and other organizations have different rules that would affect a fighter’s data. \n",
    "1. What preprocessing was done, and how did the data come to be in the form that you are using?    \n",
    "The dataset comes from three different datasets that were combined. Rajeev Warrier’s dataset was the original dataset, and it contains data for every bout from 1993-2019. Before 2010, the data was improperly recorded and is not included in the final version. Mart Jurisoo compiled the ranking for every fighter. Shortlikeafox scraped the gambling dataset and concatenated the three together to create the final version. \n",
    "1. If people are involved, were they aware of the data collection and if so, what purpose did they expect the data to be used for?    \n",
    "It is not clear whether the fighters were aware of the data collection. I am assuming they are indifferent because they voluntarily put themselves in a position where the whole world can watch them get beat up. \n",
    "1. Where can your raw source data be found, if applicable? Provide a link to the raw data?   \n",

    "### Data Limitations\n",
    "Other users have complained that the dataset mixes up which fighter is the red or blue fighter. This a problem because it would incorrectly swap the fighters' data. The sample size for most fighters is small. Most fighters only fight two times a year and because of the sport’s violent nature, they often have short careers. This leaves most fighters with only a couple fights that we can use to statistically evaluate them. "
